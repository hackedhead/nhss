The initial commit of this project comes from an old tarball I'd saved named
nhss-20080713.tar.gz which was made by Ian Kilgore of iank.org.

I reached out to him in Aug. 2015 and he responded thus:

"Great that you have a tarball, I think I lost the code a long time ago. 
Feel free to do what you want with it (consider it public domain or WTFPL, 
or whatever)"

With this in consideration I've elected to release it and my small
modifications under the MIT license. The first commit from this repository
can be considered under WTFPL/public domain as well.
